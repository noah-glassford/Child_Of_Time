# Synopsis:
Klock was just a 12-year old boy, mastering his control over space and time so that he may one day take his rightful place as king of his homeland, the T.S. Isles. However, a sudden ripple in the continuum tears holes between dimensions and is changing history. It is up to Klock to power up and save the multiverse from the wrath of the mysterious force behind these events.
